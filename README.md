UML (Unified Modeling Language)
1) Use Case
2) Class
    - Private : Variable defining, stored inside class only
    - Public : User interaction, IO Function, Used Globally

    Design of Class:

    class <Name> {

       public:
            var;
            var;
        
        private:
            Input;
            Output;
    }
